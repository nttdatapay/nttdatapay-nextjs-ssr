    4. Open Payment Page: The payment page will open after clicking on the "Pay Now" option using the obtained Atom Token ID.
 
    5. Make the Payment: Proceed with the payment on the payment page.
 
    6. Handle the Response: Process the payment response to verify the transaction status and handle success or failure accordingly.
 
## How to Use
    1. Install all the project dependencies by running the following command:
    - npm install
 
    2. Once the application is launched, the Atom Token ID will be fetched, and youâ€™ll see a sample merchant shop UI with the Atom Token ID, Transaction ID, and Amount.
 
    3. Click the "Pay Now" button to initiate the payment process.
 
    4. Make the payment on the payment page. The response will be processed, and you will be redirected to the response page.
